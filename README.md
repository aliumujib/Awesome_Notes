Whats the best way of learning to use an API? deep dive it!

This app is my practice app for iOS 10 CoreData, I learnt a lot while writing it and it cemented my knowledge of autoLayout amongst other things, theres still some bugs to fix … One day sha!

## Technology Stack

Core Data

## Used libraries

**CoreData** - An API from apple used to manage data persistence in iOS

**MapKit** - Display and use maps in your iOS app bla bla bla.

## To do

**Fix bug for autorefresh** - after adding a new item… the app fails to refresh… it gives some kin cryptic error on how the number of rows after adding must be greater than the number before adding … I would love to stay and fix it but I want to move on in the course.

**MapKit** - Implement search … for the fun of it … it is NOT hard, I’m just a lazy negro.
